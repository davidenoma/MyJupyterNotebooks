# DNA Sequencing Analysis: lambda_virus.fa and Human Genome FASTQ file with Python

### Genome Data

* lambda virus genome, at https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/ads1/data/lambda_virus.fa

* real DNA sequencing reads derived from a human https://d28rh4a8wq0iu5.cloudfront.net/ads1/data/ERR037900_1.first1000.fastq

### Algorithms Implmented

* Naive exact matching algorithm that is strand-aware. That is, instead of looking only for occurrences of P in T, additionally look for occurrences of the reverse complement of P in T

* Naive matching algirithm that allows up to 2 mismatches per occurrence.
